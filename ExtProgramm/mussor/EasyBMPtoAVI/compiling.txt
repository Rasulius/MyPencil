1) Go to http://easybmp.sourceforge.net/download.html and download the 
   most recent version of EasyBMP.

2) Extract the contents of EasyBMP_#.##.zip (where #.## is the version 
   number) into the source directory. Take care not to overwrite the 
   supplied makefile!

3) Type "make" without the quotes. That's it!
