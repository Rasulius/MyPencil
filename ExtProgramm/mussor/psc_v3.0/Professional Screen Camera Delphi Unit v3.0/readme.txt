I developed this professional screen camera component with delphi (captures the activity on a screen or delphi form and writes it into an AVI file. it supports all compressors, the program contains code derived from MRH Software Co. OPENSOURCE). 

I'm using a TThread for the recording function and a "transparent" window for a draw frame. This window is always on top of all windows and only has a frame as window region (Frame is set up by Region). In the recording function I call a paint method of the draw window for every frame (PaintBorder).
also i add at this unit capability record audio of input device.
Notice: for run this app you need to "wave audio package" a free component by Kambiz R. Khojasteh, for download update packages go to: http://www.delphiarea.com

If there's anybody who would like to share some time in improving something or just try it out, please send me an email!
